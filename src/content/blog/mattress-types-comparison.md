## Common Myths Debunked

### ❌ "Firmer is always better for back pain"
**Reality**: Medium-firm (5-6/10) is best for most back pain sufferers. Too firm can create pressure points.

### ❌ "Memory foam always sleeps hot"
**Reality**: Modern memory foam with gel, graphite, or phase change materials sleep much cooler.

### ❌ "You need to flip all mattresses"
**Reality**: Most modern mattresses are one-sided and shouldn't be flipped, only rotated.

### ❌ "Higher coil count = better mattress"
**Reality**: Coil quality and gauge matter more than count. Marketing gimmick.

### ❌ "Organic mattresses don't have chemicals"
**Reality**: Even organic mattresses use some processing. Look for GOLS/GOTS certifications.

---

## Material Combinations

Many modern mattresses combine materials:

- **Memory Foam + Gel**: Better cooling
- **Latex + Coils**: Responsive hybrid
- **Memory Foam + Coils**: Balanced hybrid
- **Latex + Memory Foam**: Layered comfort
- **Coils + Pillow Top**: Traditional luxury

## Environmental Considerations

### Most Eco-Friendly to Least:
1. **100% Natural Latex** (Avocado, PlushBeds)
2. **Organic Hybrid** (Birch, Awara)
3. **Bio-based Foam** (Amerisleep)
4. **Standard Foam** (most bed-in-a-box)
5. **Synthetic Materials**

Look for certifications:
- **GOTS**: Global Organic Textile Standard
