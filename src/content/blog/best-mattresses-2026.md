# Best Mattresses of 2026: Top 15 Picks Tested and Reviewed

After testing over 100 mattresses in 2026, our team has identified the top performers across all categories. Whether you're a side sleeper, hot sleeper, or on a budget, we've found the best mattress for your needs.

## Our Testing Process

We evaluate each mattress on:
- **Comfort** (subjective feel, pressure relief)
- **Support** (spinal alignment, firmness)
- **Cooling** (temperature regulation)
- **Motion Isolation** (partner disturbance)
- **Edge Support** (perimeter stability)
- **Durability** (materials, warranty)
- **Value** (price vs. performance)

Each mattress is tested for 30+ nights by multiple testers of different body types and sleep positions.
